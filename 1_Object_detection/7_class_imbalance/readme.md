1. Images of ncd where agumented and stored in output folder - 2_script_multiple.py
2. Now number of total images of NCD = 2810, other classes have total:  'cocci': 2476 images, 'healthy': 2404 images, 'salmo': 2625 images. Now we will increase the number of augmented images for other classes, so that each class we end up having 2810 images each.

3. Then the images from output folder where renamed, so that they can be merged manually with the existing images - 3_rename_output.py
